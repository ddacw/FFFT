## Description

The DFT of a sequence $x$ can be defined as
$$X(k) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) \omega_N^{kn}$$  
with $\omega_N = e^{-i2\pi/N}$ the root of unity. The inversion TODO.

A very common FFT is the Cooleyâ€“Tukey radix-2 algorithm. The idea is to divide the sequence $x$ into two ($x_{\text{even}}$, $x_{\text{odd}}$), performs the DFT recursively on each, and construct the transformed sequence $X$ from $X_{\text{even}}$ and $X_{\text{odd}}$. The algorithm can be implemented iteratively for better performance.

`FFT::FFTParallel` implements the iterative radix-2 algorithm with parallelized elements. The sequence has to be padded (with zeroes in our case) such that the size $N$ is a power of 2. In particular,

- `RevBitParallel` rearrange the array based on the binary representation of each index: $x_{i_1, ..., i_n} = x^{\text{old}}_{i_n,...,i_1}$.
- For each of the $\log_2(N)$ steps, `TransformParallel` compute the current FFT based on the result of the previous steps. Each partition $[x_{i}, x_{i+2^{S}}]$ can be processed individually on different threads.

### MFFT (multidimensional)
`MFFT::Transform` implements the parallelized FFT described in [(1)](<https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-8191(90)90031-4>) and [(2)](https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344263). The 1-D sequence $x$ is mapped onto P dimensions $N = N_1 \times ... \times N_p$. To compute, for instance, the DFT of a 2D $N \times M$ array, we can compute $N$ DFTs along one dimension, then $M$ DFTs of the previous result along the other. The array does not have to be padded to have a size of $2^k$, but each $N_i$ should (and in our case must) be divisible by the number of threads. You can indeed 

This function is the main focus of the project. While the final implementation is straightforward, there are several elements that was hard to get right. To start with, we did not refer to the source code (if there's any) of both papers. In fact, since the paper described the algorithm adapted to the architecture of the time, our version does not closely follow the description. Some differences includes:

- The memory is shared by all threads.
- For each major step (twiddle, transform, transpose), 

The 

### Parallelization
FFT involves lots of array operations (assign, numerical operations) that fortunately are not in conflict with each other. In practice, the data and auxilliary variables 

**WIP** of notes

- computed the indicies btw. the most tricky part of mfft.
- parallelized computation of $x^n$ but might actually be redundant. IT IS REDUNDANT LMAO.
- the use of `<execution>`.

## Application

## Extras

Assume that $N = N_1 \times ... \times N_p$.

```
N1->NP:  x[n1][...][np] = x[np + ... + (n1)*N2*...*Np]

NP->N1: x0[np][...][n1] = x[n1][...][np]
                        = x[np + ... + (n1)*N2*...*Np]


NP->N1: xp[kp][...][k1] = X[kp][...][k1]
                        = X[k1 + N1*k2 + ... + N1*...*Np-1*(kp)]
```

$$x_p[k_p,...,k_1] = \sum_{n_1, ..., n_p} x_0[n_p,...,n_1] \omega_N^{f_p g_p}$$
where
$$f_j = [n_1,...,n_j] = n_j + ... + n_1 * N_2 * ... * N_j$$
and
$$g_j = [k_j,...,k_1] = k_1 + ... + N_1 * ... * N_{j-1} * k_j$$

Recursively, $f_j = n_j * f_{j-1}$ and $g_j = g_{j-1} + L_{j-1}k_j$.

$$
X_j[k_j][...][k_1][n_p][...][n_{j+1}] = \sum_{n_j = 0}^{N_j-1} X_{j-1}[k_{j-1}][...][k_1][n_p][...][n_{j}] \omega_{L_j}^{n_j g_{j-1}} \omega_{N_j}^{n_j k_j }
